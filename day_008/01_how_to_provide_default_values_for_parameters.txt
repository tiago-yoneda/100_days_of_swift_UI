Same as js, just put a '=' after the parameter
12 is the default parameter
func printTimesTables (for number: Int, end: Int = 12) {
    for i in 1...end {
        print("\(i) x \(number) is \(1 * number)")
    }
}

printTimesTables(for: 5, end: 20)
printTimesTables(for: 8)


var characters = ["Lana", "Pam", "Ray", "Sterling"]
print(characters.count)
characters.removeAll(keepCapacity: true) <- the variable will still have space available to hold that many items, however it'll be empty
print(characters.count)

Keep in mind that the default value for keepCapacity is 'false'
