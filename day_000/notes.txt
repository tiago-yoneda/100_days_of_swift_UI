-> // -- Core Skills -- // <-
1. Swift
2. SwiftUI
3. Working with data
4. Networking
5. Version Control

-> // -- Why SwiftUI -- // <-
1. SwiftUI is easier
2. SwiftUI was built for Swift
3. SwiftUI works everywhere
4. SwiftUI is the future

---- // ----

-> // -- Extension Skills -- // <-
1. UIKit
2. Core Data - not as comfortable on swift
3. Testing
4. Architecture
5. Multithreading

-- // -- Why UIKIT -- // --
1. It's popular
2. It's powerful
3. It's precise
4. It's proven

Why not a core skill?
- It has problems too
- Everything is harder than SwiftUI
- Wasn't made for swift fo there are tons of things that aren't used
- Nothing about auto layout is auto... lol.
- Takes more time and effor to learn.

Why Core data?
Really powerful, vastly used

Why testing... it's self explanatory

Why Software Architecture
you get good by being bad for a long time 
persevere with bad code until you get bad.
Design Patterns

Why Multithreading?
Focus... don't go overboard

-> // -- Common Mistakes <- // --
1. Memorizing everything
2. Shiny object syndrome
3. Lone wolf learning
4. Using beta Software
5. Relying on Apple's documentation
6. Getting lost in Objective-C
7. Taking shots at other languages

1 - Don't try to do it. DON'T. Repetition is the way.
2 - Don't jump ship. ( go for easier stuff to escape problems )
3 - Don't work for everyone. It's easy to lose motivation. Takes longer to learn
4 - No tutorials, lots of bugs, takes time to get stable. Not worth it.
5 - It's like trying to read a dictionary. Might not be useful
6 - There are remnants in the code. But it has a notiable steep learning curve, almost nothing in common with swift.
7 - Don't compare languages, that's not how it works.
