You can use the 'for in' structure

let platforms = ["iOS", "macOS", "tvOS", "watchOS"]

for os in platform {
    print("Swift works great on \(os)")
}

swift may infer the name of the variable if it's in plural

you can use for example 1...10 (for a range),
1..<10 goes from 1 to 9.

If you don't need the variabla, you can use '_'

it's possible to make use 
print(variableName[1...]) it'll print from 1 to the end of the array
