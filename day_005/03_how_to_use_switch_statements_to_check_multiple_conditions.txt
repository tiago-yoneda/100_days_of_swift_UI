enum Weather {
    case sun, rain, wind, snow, unknown
}

var forecast = Weather.sun

if forecast ==  .sun {
    print("It should be a nice day.") // then continue with each case?
}

forecast = .snow

switch forecast {
case .sun:
    print("It should be a nice day.")
case .rain:
    print("Pack an umbrella.")
case .wind:
    print("Wear something warm")
case .snow:
    print("School is cancelled")
case .unknown:
    print("Our forecast generator is broken!")
default:
    print("This is the default case")
}

enums and if conditions can get hard after a lots of cases
so you should use switch cases.
The default case goes last, swift won't let you put a case after a default
using a 'fallthrough' will also run the next case.

Switch vs if/else if
- switch is exaustive, and swift won't let you miss any conditions on enums.
- if statements will make the value be read several times, switch only reads it once.
- switch cases allow for more settings
