Kind of variable that can only take the listed values

Looks like a switch case

enum daysOfTheWeek {
    case sunday
    case monday
    case tuesday
    case wednesday
    case thursday
    case friday
    case saturday
}

or simply 

enum daysOfTheWeek {
    case sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday
}

extra
var day = daysOfTheWeek.monday
day = .saturday

Swift knows that 'day's type is daysOfTheWeek and since types are immutable, you just need to use '.saturday' for example, because the daysOfTheWeek is already implied
