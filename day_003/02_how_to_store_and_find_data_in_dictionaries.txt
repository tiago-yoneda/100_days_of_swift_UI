Dictionaries don't have curly brackets

let employee = [
    "name": "Taylor Swift",
    "job": "Singer",
    "location": "Nashville"
]

print(employee["name", default: "Unknown"])
The dictionary might not have the property you are trying to print, using the default: "Unknown" bypasses that (it might crash the code if there's no return value)

var varName = [type: type]() - this is a dictionary
