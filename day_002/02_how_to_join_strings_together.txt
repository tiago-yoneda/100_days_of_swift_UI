- If you have two strings you can just 'add' them

let firstPart = "Hello, "
let secondPart = "world"
let wholeSentece = firstPart + secondPart

However using this method to join several strings will be slow since it will join them two by two first.

- Or you can use string interpolation
let name = "Tiago"
let age = 35
let message = "Hello, my name is \(name) and I'm \(age) years old."

You can add calculation inside strings interpolations.
print("5 * 5 is \(5*5)")
