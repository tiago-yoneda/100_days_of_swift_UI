Simple a true or false answer.

Same as creating the others variables

let goodDogs = true
let gameOver = false

let isMultiple = 120.isMultiple(if: 3)
You can use '!' to flip the value of a boolean

There's a boolean property called 'toggle' that flips it's value.

var isAuthenticated = false
print(isAuthenticated) -> prints false
isAuthenticated = !isAuthenticated
print(isAuthenticated) -> now prints true
isAuthenticated.toggle()
print(isAuthenticated) -> now prints false again
