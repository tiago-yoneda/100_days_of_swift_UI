Arrays aren't that good and dictionaries aren't good either, it's get messy

Instead we use tuples

--
Swift can't know ahead of time if dictionary keys are present
WHen you access tuple values, swift knows it'll be there
we access values using variable.parameter, not a string
Dictionary might contain hundred of other values, in tuples we specify what those values are beforehand

You can ommit the tuple names, because swift knows the names, but you must use them in the same order.
Also instead of naming the parameters, you can use numeric idexes.

func getUser() -> (String, String) {
  ("Tiago", "Yoneda")
}

let user = getUser()
print("Name: \(user.1) \(user.2))
