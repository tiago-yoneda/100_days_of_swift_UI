let playerName: String = "Yoneda"
let score: Double = 0 -> it should be int if based on the value of the variable, however swift overwrite the type and casts a double, if possible. The declared variable type has precedence over it's assignment.

To declare an empty variable, you must use the type declaration

var teams: [String] = [String]()

var cities: [String] = []

var clues = [Strings]()

enums
enum UIStyle {
    case light, dark, system
}

var style = UIStyle.light

// you can remove the enum name now that style MUST be an USStyle

style = .dark
