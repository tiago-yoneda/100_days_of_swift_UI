You can pre define a constant by creating it giving it a type annotation and LATER you can assign it's value. 

But you can assign it only since it's a contstant

Swift must know at all times what's the data types of all your variables, ALL OF THEM!!!! \o/

When should you use type annotations:
Personal preference (kind of)

Using swift automatic type inference will make the code shorter and easier to read. And makes changing the variable types easier since you only need to change it's initial value

Using it all the time will probable save some errors in the future. It may be a little more rigid but there'll be no missassignments
