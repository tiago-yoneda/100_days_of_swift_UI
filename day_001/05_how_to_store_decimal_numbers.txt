Floating point.

let number = 0.1 + 0.2
print(number) results in 0.30000000000000004

swift won't let us mix int and doubles.
To make it work you must make either the int a double, or the double an int.

let a = 1
let b = 2.0
let c = a + b won't work
either Double(a) + b, or a + Int(b)

Type safe language even if not explicit.
reminds me of typescript
